## Location
Using the Google Maps API, when a location is typed into the search bar, users are redirected to the specified location on the map. Information regarding that location's coordinates is retrieved from the API to generate information about the closest hiking trails in that region below the map.

## Weather
The weather functionality of the application ties in with the location functionality. When one of the highighted locations generated from the Google Maps API is clicked on, a four day weather forecast is listed for that area using the wunderground API. Displayed weather information includes current temperature,wind speeds and sky conditions.
